# hakuX

hakuX runs original Xbox games on Android (arm64), tuned for Adreno GPUs.

Its core runs the game's x86 code on a JIT (a FEX fork) under a
reimplementation of the Xbox kernel, and draws by decoding the push buffer
the game's own Direct3D sends the NV2A into Vulkan. Audio is the MCPX APU,
ported from xemu.

## Requirements

- An arm64 Android device with Vulkan. Custom Turnip drivers can be loaded
  for Adreno GPUs.
- Your own game images (ISO or XISO), dumped from discs you own.

No BIOS, MCPX ROM or hard disk image is needed. hakuX doesn't include any
copyrighted Xbox software.

## Building

See [android/README.md](android/README.md).

The PortareOS work currently provides a native ARM64 Linux diagnostic
build. See [native/README.linux.md](native/README.linux.md) and the
[day-one handoff](PORTAREOS_HANDOFF.md) for commands and validation status.
