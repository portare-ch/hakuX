# Upstreaming hakuX's Linux and libretro work

Status: draft for the owner's review, 2026-10-25. Nothing here has been sent
upstream.

Goal: the emulator work done in this fork lives upstream, and PortareOS keeps
everything it relies on. Two upstreams are in view:

- **rfandango/hakuX**, the emulator's home: the Linux platform layer, the
  libretro target, the shared core changes and their tests.
- **libretro**, RetroArch's distribution: the core info file, buildbot builds
  and documentation, built from wherever the libretro target lives.

portare-ch/hakuX would then shrink to what is PortareOS's own: release
packaging and notes, or nothing at all. PortareOS's integration already lives
in portare-ch/distribution and is not affected.

## 1. Where things stand

**The fork.** 38 commits, merges included, on upstream's `98b9353111`
(2026-10-24). 74 files changed, +14,252 −227. Most of that is new: the libretro
core (`native/libretro`), the Linux front end, tests, build tools and design
documents. Upstream's own files changed little:
- portability shims (an Android-property wrapper, glibc structure sizes, a
  copy fallback for guest RAM where Linux has no AHardwareBuffer);
- the exact vblank rate and its lock to a frontend's frame;
- a shared-device Vulkan start for RetroArch;
- two kernel setters (the video region added in #14).

None of them changes what Android does.

**Upstream since.** 13 commits for app version 1.1.0: the Android app's UI, and
GPUs beyond Adreno (`b09452a5c8`, `b9ed716823`). 61 files, +3,814 −1,174. A
trial merge conflicts in `CHANGELOG.md`, `hw/xbox/hle/vk/guest_ram.c` and
`hw/xbox/hle/vk/vkdev.c`.

**Upstream as a project.** One maintainer. Issues, discussions and the wiki are
disabled. No outside pull request has been merged. Two are open without a
reply: #7 (August) and #8 (September), both about launching from external
frontends. The README presents an Android app (arm64, tuned for Adreno). The
licence is GPL-3.0-or-later, as here.

**libretro.**
- **Info files** are submitted to libretro-super (`dist/info`) and mirrored to
  libretro-core-info.
- **Builds** come from a `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the core's own tree that includes
  libretro-infrastructure's ci-templates. Dolphin, a CMake core, builds Linux
  AArch64 with `.libretro-linux-cmake-aarch64` and Android with
  `.libretro-android-cmake-arm64-v8a`: the two targets hakuX can have.
- **Xbox cores already listed:** xemu and DirectXbox, both
  `is_experimental`, with `systemid = "xbox"` and `database = "Microsoft - Xbox"`
  (the database exists). xemu's info file was added on 2026-07-04, updated on
  2026-10-12. Its core keeps one machine per process ("Restart RetroArch
  between game sessions"), so a core that can't stop is listed today.

## 2. What goes where

| Area | Files | Destination | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Portability shims | `native/platform/properties.h`, `native/state/def.h` (ABI sizes), `hw/xbox/hle/vk/guest_ram.c` (copy fallback), `native/core`, `native/cpu`, `native/kernel/fixups.c` | rfandango/hakuX | No Android change; the base of everything below |
| Linux build | `native/CMakeLists.txt` options, `native/cmake/linux-*.cmake`, `tools/native/linux-deps.*`, `Dockerfile.linux`, `linux-build.sh` | rfandango/hakuX | Pinned dependencies (`linux-deps.json`) |
| Exact vblank and phase lock | `native/dev/nv2a.c`, `hw/xbox/hle/vk/display.c` | rfandango/hakuX | Generic: any frontend whose frame is the display's |
| Shared-device Vulkan | `hw/xbox/hle/vk/vkdev.c` (`hle_vk_init_shared`, frontend queue lock) | rfandango/hakuX | Goes with the libretro target |
| Console setting APIs | `native/kernel/ex.c`, `kernel.h` | rfandango/hakuX | `nc_kernel_set_av_region`; defaults keep the app's behaviour |
| libretro core | `native/libretro/*`, `native/cmake/libretro.cmake` | rfandango/hakuX, in tree as PPSSPP does; or this fork (section 6) | Section 4 lists what it still lacks |
| Tests | `tests/native/linux`, `tests/native/libretro` | With their targets | CTest; no device needed |
| Linux standalone `hakux` and tools | `native/app/linux_main.c`, `present.c` and `gamepad.c` changes, `native/dev/apu/out_*.c`, `native/run/*` | rfandango/hakuX, optional | PortareOS no longer ships `hakux` |
| Release packaging | `tools/native/linux-package.sh`, `BUILD-INFO`, `linux-v*` tags | This fork, or portare-ch/distribution | What `hakux-lr` pins today |
| Design documents | `SPEC.md`, `LIBRETRO_SPEC.md` | rfandango/hakuX, without the PortareOS specifics | Their device sections stay here |
| PortareOS notes | `PORTAREOS_HANDOFF.md`, `README.md`'s PortareOS text, `CHANGELOG.md`'s `linux-v*` sections | This fork | Upstream gets a "Linux and RetroArch" section in its README; the `HANDOFF.md` edits are reverted |
| PortareOS integration | `hakux-lr`, the Xbox system entry, the RetroArch override (save directory `/storage/saves/xbox`, run-ahead off), `runemu.sh`'s VRR, the Mesa, kernel and RetroArch patches | portare-ch/distribution, as now | Unaffected by any of this |

## 3. PortareOS's features and how each survives

| Feature | Where it lives | Upstream, it becomes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VRR, timed presents and the kernel's LFC (#8) | portare-ch/distribution | Nothing in hakuX: the core only needs its phase lock, which is generic |
| The Xbox's exact 60000/1001 Hz, one frame per `retro_run` | The core | Unchanged; it suits every RetroArch |
| The overscan crop that fills a 4:3 panel | `native/libretro/video.c` | A core option ("Crop overscan", on by default), so a TV can keep the full frame |
| The console disk and caches in `/storage/saves/xbox` | RetroArch's save directory, set by PortareOS's override | Unchanged: the core uses whatever save directory the frontend gives |
| Run-ahead off | `savestate = "false"` and the override | Unchanged |
| RetroArch ends on unload, and when RetroArch drops the Vulkan context; a relaunch starts RetroArch again (#11) | `native/libretro/core.c` | Replaced by M2's stop in process. PortareOS's build option `HAKUX_LR_END_PROCESS` keeps them behind `HAKUX_LR_STOP=0` for one release, and ends the process when a stop hangs (10 s). The relaunch's re-exec needs RetroArch's own binary with the game on its command line; elsewhere, Android included, it falls back to ending the process |
| Core options (#14) | `native/libretro/options.c` | Unchanged; PortareOS's per-game `.opt` merge in `runemu.sh` keeps working |
| A release tarball with a pinned checksum | This fork's releases | Either `hakux-lr` builds upstream's source at a pinned commit, as other PortareOS cores do, or this fork keeps cutting tarballs from upstream's tree |

## 4. What each destination still needs

### rfandango/hakuX

- **Rebase onto upstream's master:** three conflicts today, more the longer we
  wait, given upstream's pace. Merge upstream regularly from now on.
- **Pull requests a maintainer can review**, in the order of section 5, each
  building on Android. We have never built Android; macOS can run the NDK, and
  each pull request should say whether it built.
- **No PortareOS in shared code.** The libretro gate in `native/CMakeLists.txt`
  ("The libretro core is for Linux (PortareOS)") becomes Android and Linux. The
  comments that cite PortareOS, the Nova or InputPlumber in `linux_main.c`,
  `out_sdl.c`, `linux-app.cmake` and `core.c` become general or move to this
  fork's notes.
- **A way in.** With issues disabled, the first contact is a small pull request
  (the portability shims) that explains the series. Given #7 and #8, set a time
  limit; section 6 is the fallback.

### libretro

- **Stopping the core (M2).** libretro expects `retro_unload_game` to free the
  game so `retro_load_game` can run again. The core now stops in RetroArch's
  process (LIBRETRO_SPEC section 6), on Linux; not yet built or run on Android.
  Before, it ended RetroArch, which on Android closes the RetroArch app. It
  also lets PortareOS drop #11's workarounds.
- **No process-wide side effects.** `retro_load_game` sets `HAKUX_HLE_MODE`
  and `HAKUX_NATIVE_BASE` with `setenv`; these become API calls.
- **Android in the core build.** The CMake gate goes. The core then builds
  with the NDK, without SDL or JNI, on RetroArch's Vulkan device.
  - **No custom Turnip:** RetroArch owns the device, so adrenotools can't load
    one. Phones on Qualcomm drivers older than Vulkan 1.3 can't run the core
    (upstream's app recommends Turnip for them).
  - **Guest RAM:** AHardwareBuffer sharing works in any app process.
- **libretro's CI.**
  - A `.gitlab-ci.yml` with `linux-cmake-aarch64` and
    `android-cmake-arm64-v8a`.
  - FEX needs clang, and the templates' images default to GCC 14: an image or
    a `CC` override has to be found.
  - The dependencies `linux-deps.py` downloads at build time become
    submodules or vendored sources.
  - The Linux core links against an older glibc than Debian's, for the
    buildbot's users.
- **The info file.**
  - `systemid = "xbox"` instead of `microsoft_xbox`, to match libretro's
    database, playlists and thumbnails.
  - `core_options = "true"` with `core_options_version = "2.0"`: #14 left
    `"false"`.
  - `notes` for ARM64 only, Vulkan 1.3, no BIOS or hard disk image.
  - Submitted to libretro-super.
- **A docs page** in libretro's docs: requirements, options, the data folder,
  what's missing.

## 5. Order of work

| # | Step | Where | Ready when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Fixes in this fork: the info file; PortareOS-only behaviour behind one build option; `setenv` replaced; overscan option; an Android build of the fork | portare-ch/hakuX | Container tests pass and the Android build works; on the Nova, PortareOS's package behaves as today |
| 1 | Merge upstream's 1.1.0 into the fork, then keep merging | portare-ch/hakuX | No conflicts left; Burnout 3 and BLACK as before on the Nova |
| 2 | Pull request: portability shims and the Linux build | rfandango/hakuX | Upstream reviews it, or the time limit passes |
| 3 | Pull request: exact vblank, shared-device Vulkan, console setting APIs | rfandango/hakuX | Android unchanged in upstream's own checks |
| 4 | Pull request: the libretro target, its tests, the Linux docs | rfandango/hakuX | CTest in upstream's tree |
| 5 | Pull request, optional: the Linux standalone and its tools | rfandango/hakuX | Only if upstream wants a Linux app |
| 6 | M2: stop, unload, load again, reset | Wherever the core lives | LIBRETRO_SPEC's M2 gate: 100 load/run/unload cycles in one process, nothing left behind |
| 7 | libretro submission: CI file, info file, docs page | libretro-super, libretro's docs, the core's tree | The buildbot builds Linux AArch64 and Android arm64 |
| 8 | PortareOS on the upstream source | portare-ch/distribution | `hakux-lr` builds or fetches the upstream core with the PortareOS build option, at a pinned commit |

Steps 0, 1 and 6 help PortareOS on their own and need nobody outside.

Progress, 2026-10-25: steps 1 and 0 are on the branches
`portareos/upstream-1.1.0` (the merge) and `portareos/upstream-prep` (the
fix-ups), not merged yet. Both build for Android with NDK r29. Step 6 (M2)
is on `m2-stop`. A video driver rebuild mid-game (`VIDEO_REINIT`, which
PortareOS's RetroArch has) crashed RetroArch until the core stopped letting
it cache the context.

## 6. If upstream doesn't take it

This fork becomes the libretro core's home, as many libretro cores are forks
that follow their emulator:
- merge upstream regularly, and keep the shared-code changes small and rebased;
- send upstream only what it asks for;
- the libretro CI builds from this repository, and the info file credits
  upstream's authors.

PortareOS is unchanged either way.

## 7. Decisions for the owner

1. **The libretro target's home:** upstream's tree (the aim), or this fork
   from the start.
2. **M2's priority:** needed for general RetroArch, Android especially, though
   PortareOS gains nothing from it on its own.
3. **The Linux standalone `hakux`:** offer it upstream, or keep it here as a
   development tool.
4. **First contact:** who approaches upstream, and how, with issues
   disabled.
5. **`systemid`:** change it to `"xbox"` now. Neither portare-ch/distribution
   nor the launcher reads it.
